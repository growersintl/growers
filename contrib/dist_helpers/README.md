Helper scripts for GrowersCoin binary distributions
===================================================

The next files are distributed with the GrowersCoin daemon for Windows, as mentioned in the
[Windows build notes](../../doc/build-msw.md).

* `Start daemon.vbs` is a script that detects if the configuration directory
  for the growers daemon is in place to launch the daemon in the background.

* `Stop daemon.cmd` stops the growers daemon.
